# Lakehouse Plumber CI/CD Implementation

This repository now includes enterprise-grade CI/CD workflows for Lakehouse Plumber deployments following DataOps best practices and [Databricks official guidelines](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/ci-cd/github).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Tag-Based Promotion Strategy
- **Development**: Auto-deploy on `main` branch push
- **Test**: Developer-triggered with `v*-test` tags  
- **Production**: Approval-gated with `v*-prod` tags
- **Rollback**: Emergency and planned rollback with approval gates

### Core Principles
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: YAML configurations only
- ✅ **Version Consistency**: Same commit SHA across environments
- ✅ **Environment Isolation**: Separate substitution files and secrets
- ✅ **Approval Gates**: Manual approval for production changes
- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail**: Full deployment history and rollback capability

```

## 🔄 Deployment Workflows

### 1. Development Workflow
```bash
# Automatic deployment on main branch
git push origin main
→ Triggers: validate → deploy-dev
```

### 2. Test Promotion  
```bash
# Self-service test deployment
git tag v1.2.3-test
git push origin v1.2.3-test
→ Triggers: validate → deploy-test → integration-tests
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash  
# Production deployment with approval
git tag v1.2.3-prod
git push origin v1.2.3-prod
→ Triggers: validate → **APPROVAL REQUIRED** → deploy-prod → health-checks
```

### 4. Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Emergency rollback with approval  
git tag v1.2.1-rollback
git push origin v1.2.1-rollback
→ Triggers: **APPROVAL REQUIRED** → emergency-rollback → critical-tests
```

## 🔍 Key Features

### Pull Request Validation
- ✅ YAML syntax validation with `yamllint`
- ✅ LHP configuration validation (`lhp validate`)  
- ✅ Security scanning for hardcoded secrets
- ✅ Dry-run generation validation
- ✅ Bundle configuration validation

### Deployment Pipeline
- 🚀 Automated dev deployment on main branch
- 🏷️ Tag-based test and production promotion
- ⚡ Fast deployment using `databricks/setup-cli@main`
- 📊 Comprehensive deployment reporting
- 🏥 Post-deployment health checks

### Rollback Capabilities  
- 🚨 Emergency rollback (sub-10 minutes with approval)
- 🔧 Planned maintenance rollback
- 📝 Automated incident report generation
- 🔍 Rollback success verification

### Monitoring & Drift Detection
- 📅 Daily drift detection at 8 AM UTC
- 🎯 GitHub issue creation for drift alerts
- 🔍 Bundle status monitoring
- ⚡ Manual drift detection trigger

## 🔐 Security Features

### Multi-Layer Security
- 🛡️ Branch protection rules on `main`
- 🔐 Environment-specific secrets isolation
- ✅ Required PR reviews and approvals
- 🕵️ Secret scanning in YAML files
- 👤 Service principal authentication

### Access Control
- 🏢 GitHub environment protection rules
- 👥 Required reviewers (Mmodarre) for production
- 🚨 Separate emergency rollback approvals
- 📋 Complete audit trail in GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Environment Configuration

| Environment | Trigger | Protection | Approver |
|-------------|---------|------------|----------|
| `development` | Push to `main` | None | Auto |
| `test` | Tag `v*-test` | None | Auto |
| `production` | Tag `v*-prod` | Required Review | Mmodarre |
| `production-emergency` | Tag `v*-rollback` | Required Review | Mmodarre |
| `production-maintenance` | Tag `v*-maintenance` | Required Review | Mmodarre |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Complete Setup
Follow the detailed instructions in [`GITHUB_SETUP.md`](./GITHUB_SETUP.md):
- Configure GitHub environments and secrets
- Set up Databricks service principals  
- Configure branch protection rules
- Test the workflows

### 2. First Deployment
```bash
# Test the complete workflow
git checkout -b test-deployment
echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md
git commit -am "Test CI/CD setup"
git push origin test-deployment

# Create PR (triggers validation)
# Merge PR (triggers dev deployment)  
# Tag for test: git tag v1.0.0-test && git push origin v1.0.0-test
# Tag for prod: git tag v1.0.0-prod && git push origin v1.0.0-prod
```

### 3. Monitor Deployments
- Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow status
- Review deployment summaries in workflow runs
- Monitor Databricks workspaces for deployed resources

## 📊 Workflow Status

All workflows are now configured and ready:

- ✅ **Main CI/CD Pipeline** - Tag-based promotion with validation
- ✅ **Rollback Procedures** - Emergency and planned rollback workflows  
- ✅ **Drift Detection** - Daily monitoring with GitHub issue alerts
- ✅ **Helper Scripts** - Health checks and validation scripts
- ✅ **Documentation** - Complete setup and usage guides

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Custom Validation
Edit `.github/workflows/lakehouse-cicd.yml` to add:
- Custom data quality tests
- Security scans
- Performance validations
- Integration tests

### Custom Health Checks
Modify `scripts/production-health-check.sh` to include:
- Business-specific validations
- Data freshness checks  
- Performance monitoring
- Custom alert integrations

### Environment-Specific Logic
Add environment-specific steps using:
```yaml
- name: Production-only step
  if: matrix.environment == 'prod'
  run: echo "Production-specific validation"
```
